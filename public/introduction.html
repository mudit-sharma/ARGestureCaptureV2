        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p>This study consists of a set of 11 common 3D data interactions. For each of them you will be shown:
            <ul>
                <li>Name of the interaction (zoom, pan, scale, etc.).</li>
                <li>Description of the interaction.</li>
                <li>A 3-D visual representation of what the interaction will do.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>You will then be asked to record your own hand gesture(s) that you believe will achieve this task. </p>
        <p><b><u>IMPORTANT NOTES:</u></b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The 3-D visual representation is not <b><i>INTERACTIVE</i></b>. Meaning, it is only for demonstration of what the interaction is, it does not react to your hand gesture.</li>
            <li>There is no <u><i>“right way”</i></u> of doing the gestures! The study is aimed at discovering potential novel gestures that have not exist in current interaction designs or to solidify the effectiveness of existing ones. Just do what you feel the most natural!</li>
            <li>We encourage you to record more than one gestures if you have more than one idea of how to do a task! But at least one gesture for each interaction is required to complete the study.</li>
            <li>After pressing the <b>Record</b> button, there will be a 5-second delay before the recording starts so you can get in a comfortable position to record.</li>
            <li>You can choose to re-record a gesture in case you make a mistake or want to make changes to the gesture.</li>
        </ul>
